## description

Rehear is an audio player with which you can review recorded material and mark parts that are interesting.

You load an audio file (K1) which gets played back immediately. Every time you like what you hear you press K3 and a timecode marker is written to a text-file.

By turning enc3 you can pause the playback. 

K2 lets you fast forward.

marked positions will be saved in “/home/we/dust/code/rehear/markers.txt”
